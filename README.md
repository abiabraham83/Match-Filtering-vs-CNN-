# Match-Filtering-vs-CNN-
Contains results and notebooks from my project 'Convolution Neural Network, a possible tool to replace matched filtering for gravitaional wave detection.' 
There are multiple notebook with different versions each trying to improve the models, note that CNN v3 is not the optimal CNN model, for this work it would be CNN v2.
